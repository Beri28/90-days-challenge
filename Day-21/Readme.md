counterGame()

Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game. They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of 2. If it is, they divide it by 2. If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of 2. Whoever reduces the number to 1 wins the game. Louise always starts.

Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.
